# how did the singularity happen?

The singularity is a hypothetical future point in time when technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unfathomable changes to human civilization. Futurist Ray Kurzweil predicted that the singularity will occur in about 2045. However, some researchers believe that this event may be much more imminent, especially with the advent of quantum computing.

It’s important to note that there is no consensus on when or if the singularity will happen. Some researchers believe that it has already happened. The truth is that no one can tell when Singularity will happen, if it’ll happen or if it has already happened.
